# Base64-Zlib-Encoder-Decoder

A Python script for compressing and decompressing text files using the zlib compression algorithm and base64 encoding.

## Introduction

This project provides two Python scripts, `encode.py` and `decode.py`, that allow users to compress and decompress text files seamlessly using the popular zlib compression algorithm along with base64 encoding.

## Usage

### `encode.py`

To compress a text file, run the `encode.py` script, providing the input file path and the output file path when prompted.
